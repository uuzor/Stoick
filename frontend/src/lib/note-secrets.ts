/**
 * Deterministic note secrets, so the wallet's own notes are recoverable from chain data
 * on any device (SPEC — note recovery).
 *
 * Deposits are public (the `DepositEvent` carries asset + amount), so instead of a random
 * blinding we derive it as `hash4(nsk, assetId, amount, salt)`. A fresh device can then
 * recompute a deposit note's commitment from the event and match it. `salt` is the wallet's
 * running per-`(asset, amount)` deposit index — reconstructed at recovery by counting owned
 * deposits in ledger order (so foreign deposits never consume it).
 *
 * Received and change notes stay random-blinded but are delivered as encrypted memos, so
 * this only covers the outputs whose amount is public on-chain.
