 * Encrypted note/order delivery (note discovery).

 * The sealed-box transport now lives in `@wraith/sdk` (note-crypto), so the wallet and the
 * off-chain matcher encrypt/decrypt identically — one source of truth, no drift. This module
 * is a thin re-export kept so existing frontend imports (`./note-crypto`) stay stable.
