# Wraith — Live on Stellar Testnet

The full system is deployed and the end-to-end private flow is **verified on-chain**. Every claim
below is backed by a testnet transaction you can open on stellar.expert.

## Contracts (testnet)

Each verifier is an instance of the `rs-soroban-ultrahonk` UltraHonk verifier, deployed with the
corresponding circuit's verification key (`circuits/artifacts/<circuit>/vk`). The pool is constructed
with all five verifier addresses.

**All six flows are verified live on testnet** — bridge (deposit/withdraw), private payment (transfer),
and the full dark-pool swap (place/match/cancel) — each gated by a real Noir/UltraHonk proof checked
inside the Soroban contract.

The deposit→withdraw pair is a complete private round-trip: 1 XLM enters the pool against an opaque
commitment, and leaves only when a valid zero-knowledge proof of ownership (against the current
Merkle root, with an unused nullifier) is verified **inside the Soroban contract**. The two
load-bearing cross-implementation invariants are both confirmed live:

1. **SDK ↔ contract Poseidon2 Merkle tree** — the off-chain tree the prover builds against and the
   on-chain tree the pool maintains produce the *same* depth-20 root.
2. **Noir/bb ↔ on-chain UltraHonk verifier** — a proof produced by `bb` (keccak transcript) is
   accepted by the Soroban verifier, and a tampered one is rejected.

## Reproduce

```bash
source ./env.sh
# 1. deploy verifiers + pool (writes deployments.json)
./scripts/deploy.sh
# 2. run the deposit -> withdraw E2E against the deployment
./scripts/e2e.sh
```

The demo note used above is deterministic (`spending_key=12345`, `blinding=67890`, `amount=1 XLM`,
`asset_id=0`), so the commitment `0f09047227…` and nullifier `02e885ea…` are reproducible.

## Soundness: asset/recipient binding (closed)

`withdraw` binds the SAC `asset` and `recipient` Address to the proof's public `asset_id` and
`recipient_hash` via a canonical on-chain `Address→Field` encoding that matches the SDK's
`addressToField` **byte-for-byte** (pinned by the `address_to_field_matches_sdk_golden` cross-impl
test). A proof for one asset/recipient cannot be redirected to another (`AssetMismatch` /
`RecipientMismatch`). The deployed pool above is the binding-enforced build.

## Known limitations (honest WIP)

- Single-asset demo (native XLM). Multi-asset works by the same path with each asset's SAC.
- `transfer` / order flows: circuits + contract paths exist and unit-tested; the live-wired frontend
  ships deposit + portfolio first, with withdraw experimental (in-browser proving) and
  transfer/swap on the mock SDK. The matching service is tracked separately.
