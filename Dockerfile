# Wraith off-chain matcher — production image.
#
# Builds @wraith/sdk + @wraith/matcher from the pnpm monorepo and runs the HTTP
# matching service (POST/GET /orders, GET /health) plus its background match loop.
# Live proving uses @aztec/bb.js (WASM) — no native `bb` binary required, but the
# first proof downloads the SRS over HTTPS (cache it with a volume; see compose).
