/**
 * Wraith matcher data model.
 *
 * A {@link SubmittedOrder} is what a trader hands the off-chain matching service: the
 * on-chain order commitment plus the full order preimage (side/price/amount/assets/
 * owner_key/nonce). Those preimage fields are exactly the `match_orders` circuit's
 * private inputs for one order (SPEC sec 8.4 / SHARED sec 7), so the matcher needs them
 * to build a settlement proof — it cannot, however, steal funds: settlement is
 * ZK-enforced (see README "Trust model").
 *
 * A {@link Match} is the pure, deterministic economic result of crossing two orders,
 * mirroring the circuit's math byte-for-byte (midpoint exec price, floor rounding,
 * fill = min(amounts), residual on the larger side, buyer price-improvement refund only
 * when fully filled). It carries amounts only; the per-note commitments (which need
 * fresh blindings/nonces) are assembled later in `prover.ts`.
